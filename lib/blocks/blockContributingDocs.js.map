Please fully fill out all required fields in the most appropriate issue form.\n\n## Sending Contributions\n\nSending your own changes as contribution is always appreciated!\nThere are two steps involved:\n\n1. [Finding an Issue](#finding-an-issue)\n2. [Sending a Pull Request](#sending-a-pull-request)\n\n### Finding an Issue\n\nWith the exception of very small typos, all changes to this repository generally need to correspond to an [unassigned open issue marked as \\`status: accepting prs\\` on the issue tracker](https://github.com/${options.owner}/${options.repository}/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22status%3A+accepting+prs%22+no%3Aassignee+).\nIf this is your first time contributing, consider searching for [unassigned issues that also have the \\`good first issue\\` label](https://github.com/${options.owner}/${options.repository}/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+label%3A%22status%3A+accepting+prs%22+no%3Aassignee+).\nIf the issue you'd like to fix isn't found on the issue, see [Reporting Issues](#reporting-issues) for filing your own (please do!).\n\n#### Issue Claiming\n\nWe don't use any kind of issue claiming system.\nWe've found in the past that they result in accidental [\"licked cookie\"](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20091201-00/?p=15843) situations where contributors claim an issue but run out of time or energy trying before sending a PR.\n\nIf an unassigned issue has been marked as \\`status: accepting prs\\` and an open PR does not exist, feel free to send a PR.\nPlease don't post comments asking for permission or stating you will work on an issue.\n\n### Sending a Pull Request\n\nOnce you've identified an open issue accepting PRs that doesn't yet have a PR sent, you're free to send a pull request.\nBe sure to fill out the pull request template's requested information -- otherwise your PR will likely be closed.\n\nPRs are also expected to have a title that adheres to [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0).\nOnly PR titles need to be in that format, not individual commits.\nDon't worry if you get this wrong: you can always change the PR title after sending it.\nCheck [previously merged PRs](https://github.com/${options.owner}/${options.repository}/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+-label%3Adependencies+) for reference.\n\n#### Draft PRs\n\nIf you don't think your PR is ready for review, [set it as a draft](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request#converting-a-pull-request-to-a-draft).\nDraft PRs won't be reviewed.\n\n#### Granular PRs\n\nPlease keep pull requests single-purpose: in other words, don't attempt to solve multiple unrelated problems in one pull request.\nSend one PR per area of concern.\nMulti-purpose pull requests are harder and slower to review, block all changes from being merged until the whole pull request is reviewed, and are difficult to name well with semantic PR titles.\n\n#### Pull Request Reviews\n\nWhen a PR is not in draft, it's considered ready for review.\nPlease don't manually \\`@\\` tag anybody to request review.\nA maintainer will look at it when they're next able to.\n\nPRs should have passing [GitHub status checks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks) before review is requested (unless there are explicit questions asked in the PR about any failures).\n\n#### Asking Questions\n\nIf you need help and/or have a question, posting a comment in the PR is a great way to do so.\nThere's no need to tag anybody individually.\nOne of us will drop by and help when we can.\n\nPlease post comments as [line comments](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#adding-line-comments-to-a-pull-request) when possible, so that they can be threaded.\nYou can [resolve conversations](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations) on your own when you feel they're resolved - no need to comment explicitly and/or wait for a maintainer.\n\n#### Requested Changes\n\nAfter a maintainer reviews your PR, they may request changes on it.\nOnce you've made those changes, [re-request review on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews#re-requesting-a-review).\n\nPlease try not to force-push commits to PRs that have already been reviewed.\nDoing so makes it harder to review the changes.\nWe squash merge all commits so there's no need to try to preserve Git history within a PR branch.\n\nOnce you've addressed all our feedback by making code changes and/or started a followup discussion, [re-request review](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews#re-requesting-a-review) from each maintainer whose feedback you addressed.\n\nOnce all feedback is addressed and the PR is approved, we'll ensure the branch is up to date with \\`main\\` and merge it for you.\n\n#### Post-Merge Recognition\n\nOnce your PR is merged, if you haven't yet been added to the [_Contributors_ table in the README.md](../README.md#contributors) for its [type of contribution](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key \"Allcontributors emoji key\"), you should be soon.\nPlease do ping the maintainer who merged your PR if that doesn't happen within 24 hours - it was likely an oversight on our end!\n\n## Emojis & Appreciation\n\nIf you made it all the way to the end, bravo dear user, we love you.\nPlease include an emoji in the bottom of your issues and PRs to signal to us that you did in fact read this file and are trying to conform to it as best as possible.\n${options.emoji} is a good starter if you're not sure which to use.\n`,\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t};\n\t},\n\ttransition() {\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t\taddons: [blockRemoveFiles({ files: [\"CONTRIBUTING.md\"] })],\n\t\t};\n\t},\n});\n"],"mappings":";;;;AAGA,MAAa,wBAAwB,KAAK,YAAY;CACrD,OAAO,EACN,MAAM,qBACN;CACD,QAAQ,EAAE,WAAW;AACpB,SAAO,EACN,OAAO,EACN,WAAW,EACV,mBAAmB;;gDAEwB,QAAQ,WAAW,MAAM,QAAQ,MAAM;;;;;;;;;;sEAUjB,QAAQ,MAAM,GAAG,QAAQ,WAAW;;;;;;;;;;;;gNAYsG,QAAQ,MAAM,GAAG,QAAQ,WAAW;uJAC7F,QAAQ,MAAM,GAAG,QAAQ,WAAW;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;mDAmBxI,QAAQ,MAAM,GAAG,QAAQ,WAAW;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;EAoDrF,QAAQ,MAAM;GAEX,EACD,EACD;;CAEF,aAAa;AACZ,SAAO,EACN,QAAQ,CAAC,iBAAiB,EAAE,OAAO,CAAC,kBAAkB,EAAE,CAAC,CAAC,EAC1D;;CAEF,CAAC"}
