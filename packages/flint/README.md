**Flint** is an experimental new linter.
It's a proof-of-concept to explore the concepts in the following blog posts:

- [Hybrid Linters: The Best of Both Worlds](https://www.joshuakgoldberg.com/blog/hybrid-linters-the-best-of-both-worlds)
- [If I Wrote a Linter, Part 1: Architecture](https://www.joshuakgoldberg.com/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-1-architecture)
- [If I Wrote a Linter, Part 2: Developer Experience](https://www.joshuakgoldberg.com/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-2-developer-experience)
- [If I Wrote a Linter, Part 3: Ecosystem](https://www.joshuakgoldberg.com/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-3-ecosystem)
- [If I Wrote a Linter, Part 4: Summary](https://www.joshuakgoldberg.com/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-4-summary)

This project might go nowhere.
It might show some of those ideas to be wrong.
It might become a real linter.
Only time will tell.

In the meantime, come talk about it on the [Flint Discord](https://discord.gg/rdC2XPCmn5).

## Usage

Coming soon.
