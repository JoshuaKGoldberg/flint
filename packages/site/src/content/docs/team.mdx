Flint is run by a set of independent volunteer maintainers as a fully open source project.
We are not associated with any one company, and are wholly dedicated to proving out the Flint experiment.

I'm a maintainer on [typescript-eslint](https://typescript-eslint.io), a committer team member of [ESLint](https://eslint.org), a co-founder of [SquiggleConf](https://squiggleconf.com), the author of _[Learning TypeScript](https://learningtypescript.com)_ (O'Reilly), and am all around excited about great web developer tooling.",
				"Flint is the culmination of that decade of open source software work. Linters are how I got into contributing to open source dev tooling online, and I want to make sure future waves of web developers can experience a fast, powerful, and _approachable_ linter as much as possible.",
