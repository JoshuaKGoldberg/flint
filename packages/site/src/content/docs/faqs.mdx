## Common Questions

### How fast is Flint?

Flint is fast.

Flint isn't _blazing_ fast the way native speed linters such as [Biome's linter](https://biomejs.dev) and [Oxlint](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter) are.
Native speed linters will always be faster than hybrid-speed linters such as Flint.

However, Flint is still very fast compared to traditional TypeScript linters such as ESLint with typescript-eslint:

- It utilizes an intelligent cross-file cache that significantly reduces redundant linting work.
- Its architecture is optimized for cross-file linting, enabling performance optimizations.

Expect performance comparisons to be posted Soon ™️.
