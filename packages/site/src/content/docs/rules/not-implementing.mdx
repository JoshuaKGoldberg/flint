:::danger
Flint is still very early stage and experimental.
Not all features have been implemented.
:::

:::tip
Rules are grouped into plugins that you can opt into.
See [Rules](/rules) for an overview of how rules are sorted into plugins.
:::

These rules will not be implemented as a part of Flint.
They are all too opinionated and/or too niche to be kept in the Flint project.
They're free to be implemented as a community third-party Flint plugin.
