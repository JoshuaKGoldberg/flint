Flint's jsx plugin includes rules targeted to code that renders JSX.
It comes provided with the `flint` npm package.

## Presets

Flint's JSX plugin provides the following presets:

| Preset                                | Recommended   | Description                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[`logical`](#logical)**             | ✅ Always     | Common rules for finding bugs and enforcing good logical practices for JSX.     |
| **[`logicalStrict`](#logicalstrict)** | ☑️ When Ready | Additional rules for finding bugs and enforcing good logical practices for JSX. |
| **[`stylistic`](#stylistic)**         | ✅ Always     | Common rules for consistent styling and best stylistic practices for JSX.       |

If you are just getting started with linting, Flint recommends using the [`logical`](#logical) and [`stylistic`](#stylistic) presets:

```ts title="flint.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, ts } from "flint";

export default defineConfig({
	use: [
		{
			files: ts.files.all,
			rules: [ts.presets.logical, ts.presets.stylistic],
		},
	],
});
```

If you are experienced with both JavaScript/TypeScript and linting, Flint recommends additionally using the [`logicalStrict`](#logicalstrict) preset:

```ts title="flint.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, ts } from "flint";

export default defineConfig({
	use: [
		{
			files: ts.files.all,
			rules: [ts.presets.logicalStrict, ts.presets.stylistic],
		},
	],
});
```

### `logical`

Rules that find bugs and enforce best practices and catch common pitfalls around JSX for most-to-all JavaScript and TypeScript files.

```ts title="flint.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, jsx, ts } from "flint";

export default defineConfig({
	use: [
		{
			files: ts.files.all,
			rules: jsx.presets.logical,
		},
	],
});
```

### `logicalStrict`

Additional logical rules that enforce best practices which are not always straightforward to implement.
These rules are recommended for projects where a majority of developers are experienced with both JavaScript/TypeScript and using a linter.

```ts title="flint.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, jsx, ts } from "flint";

export default defineConfig({
	use: [
		{
			files: ts.files.all,
			rules: jsx.presets.logicalStrict,
		},
	],
});
```

This preset's rules are a superset of those in [`logical`](#logical).

### `stylistic`

Rules that enforce consistent JSX styling and best stylistic practices for most-to-all JavaScript and TypeScript files.

```ts title="flint.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, jsx, ts } from "flint";

export default defineConfig({
	use: [
		{
			files: ts.files.all,
			rules: jsx.presets.stylistic,
		},
	],
});
```
