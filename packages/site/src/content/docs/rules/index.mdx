Flint is still very early stage and experimental.
Not all features have been implemented.
:::

Flint will provide a comprehensive set of rules for all languages common to most typical web development projects.
Rules are grouped into plugins that you can opt into as you choose.

Plugins are grouped into two categories:

- **[Core Plugins](#core-plugins)**: These come as part of the `flint` package on npm.
  They're applicable to any project using the language they lint for.
- **[Focused Plugins](#focused-plugins)**: These are for specific areas of projects or code styles.
  They come in separate npm packages under `@flint.fyi/`.

## Core Plugins

These come as part of the `flint` package on npm.
They're applicable to any project using the language they lint for.

<PluginCards plugins={Object.values(pluginCardDataById.core)} />

## Focused Plugins

These are for specific areas of projects or code styles.
They come in separate npm packages under `@flint.fyi/`.

<PluginCards plugins={Object.values(pluginCardDataById.focused)} />

## Rules

These tables contain all the rules considered for inclusion in Flint.
That includes every non-deprecated rule provided by &gt;=1 popular linter.

### Implementing

These rules will be implemented as a part of Flint.
Each is equivalent to at least one existing rule in another linter.

<RulesTable implementing small sortBy="name" />

### Not Implementing

These rules will not be implemented as a part of Flint.
They are all too opinionated and/or too niche to be kept in the Flint project.
They're free to be implemented as a community third-party Flint plugin.

<RulesTable implementing={false} small sortBy="name" />
