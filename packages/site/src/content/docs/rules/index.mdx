title: Flint's Rules
---

import { RulesTable } from "~/components/RulesTable.tsx";

:::danger
Flint is still very early stage and experimental.
Not all features have been implemented.
:::

Flint will provide a comprehensive set of rules for all languages common to most typical web development projects.

## Implementing

These rules will be implemented as a part of Flint.
Each is equivalent to at least one existing rule in another linter.

<RulesTable implementing />

## Not Implementing

These rules will not be implemented as a part of Flint.
They are all too opinionated and/or too niche to be kept in the Flint project.
They're free to be implemented as a community third-party Flint plugin.

<RulesTable implementing={false} />
