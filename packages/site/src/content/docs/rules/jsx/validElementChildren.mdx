Void elements (also called self-closing or empty elements) are HTML elements that cannot have children.
These elements, such as `<br>`, `<img>`, and `<input>`, are self-closing by definition and attempting to give them children violates the HTML specification.

## Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="❌ Incorrect">

```tsx
<br>text content</br>
```

```tsx
<img>Invalid children</img>
```

```tsx
<input>
	<span>Not allowed</span>
</input>
```

```tsx
<hr>{expression}</hr>
```

```tsx
<meta>
	<div>Content</div>
</meta>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="✅ Correct">

```tsx
<br />
```

```tsx
<img src="photo.jpg" />
```

```tsx
<input type="text" />
```

```tsx
<hr />
```

```tsx
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
```

```tsx
<div>
	<br />
	Text content around void elements
</div>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Options

This rule is not configurable.

## When Not To Use It

This rule should not be disabled as void elements with children violates the HTML specification and will cause unpredictable browser behavior.
