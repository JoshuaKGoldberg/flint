In GitHub Flavored Markdown tables, data rows should not have more cells than the header row.
When a data row has more cells than the header, extra cells can lead to lost data or rendering issues.
This rule helps ensure table consistency by preventing data rows from exceeding the header's column count.

Note that rows with fewer cells than the header are allowed, as they render correctly with empty cells.

## Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="❌ Incorrect">

```markdown
| Head1 | Head2 |
| ----- | ----- | ---- |
| R1C1  | R1C2  | R1C3 |
```

```markdown
| A   |
| --- | --- |
| 1   | 2   |
```

```markdown
| Header | Header | Header |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ----- |
| Cell   | Cell   | Cell   | Extra |
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="✅ Correct">

```markdown
| Header | Header |
| ------ | ------ |
| Cell   | Cell   |
| Cell   | Cell   |
```

```markdown
| Header | Header | Header |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Cell   | Cell   |        |
```

```markdown
| Col A | Col B | Col C |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1     |       | 3     |
| 4     | 5     |
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## When Not To Use It

If you have a non-standard Markdown processing pipeline that handles tables with extra cells correctly, you might choose to disable this rule.
However, adhering to this rule is recommended for typical GFM rendering and data consistency.
