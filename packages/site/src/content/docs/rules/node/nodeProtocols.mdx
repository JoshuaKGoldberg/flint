import { RuleEquivalents } from "~/components/RuleEquivalents";
import RuleSummary from "~/components/RuleSummary.astro";

<RuleSummary plugin="node" rule="nodeProtocols" />

The `node:` protocol makes it explicit that the module is a Node.js built-in, preventing confusion with npm packages that might have the same name.
The protocol is supported in Node.js 16+ and is the recommended way to import built-ins.

## Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="❌ Incorrect">

```ts
import fs from "fs";

import path from "path";

import { readFile } from "fs";

import fsPromises from "fs/promises";

const crypto = require("crypto");
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="✅ Correct">

```ts
import fs from "node:fs";

import path from "node:path";

import { readFile } from "node:fs";

import fsPromises from "node:fs/promises";

const crypto = require("node:crypto");
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Options

This rule is not configurable.

## When Not To Use It

If you need to support Node.js versions older than 16, you should not use this rule, as the `node:` protocol was introduced in Node.js 16.0.0.
