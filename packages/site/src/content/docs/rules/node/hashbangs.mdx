import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

import { RuleEquivalents } from "~/components/RuleEquivalents";
import RuleSummary from "~/components/RuleSummary.astro";

<RuleSummary plugin="node" rule="hashbangs" />

Files listed in `package.json`'s `bin` field are meant to be executed directly and should start with a hashbang (e.g., `#!/usr/bin/env node`).
Other files should not have hashbangs.
This ensures executable files work correctly on Unix-like systems while keeping non-executable files clean.

## Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="❌ Incorrect">

```ts
// In a file listed in package.json's bin field:
console.log("hello");

// In a regular source file:
#!/usr/bin/env node
console.log("hello");
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="✅ Correct">

```ts
// In a file listed in package.json's bin field:
#!/usr/bin/env node
console.log("hello");

// In a regular source file:
console.log("hello");
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Options

This rule is not configurable.

## When Not To Use It

If your project doesn't use the `bin` field in `package.json` or you have a custom build process that handles hashbangs differently, you might not need this rule.
