Flint's performance plugin includes rules targeted to code that runs with specialized performance needs.
As in, this plugin enforces performance best practices that only apply when code must be as performant as possible.

<PackageManagers type="install" pkg="@flint.fyi/plugin-performance" />

## Presets

Flint's performance plugin provides the following preset:

| Preset                    | Recommended | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[`logical`](#logical)** | âœ… Always   | Common rules for finding bugs and good practices for high-performance code. |

Flint recommends using the [`logical`](#logical) preset:

```ts title="flint.config.ts"
import { performance } from "@flint.fyi/performance";
import { defineConfig } from "flint";

export default defineConfig({
	use: [
		{
			files: performance.files.all,
			rules: [performance.presets.logical],
		},
	],
});
```

### `logical`

Rules that find bugs and enforce good performance practices and catch common pitfalls for most-to-all JavaScript and TypeScript files.

```ts title="flint.config.ts"
import { performance } from "@flint.fyi/performance";
import { defineConfig } from "flint";

export default defineConfig({
	use: [
		{
			files: performance.files.all,
			rules: performance.presets.logical,
		},
	],
});
```
