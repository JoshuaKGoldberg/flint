## Presets

Flint's YAML plugin provides the following presets:

| Preset                                    | Recommended   | Description                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[`logical`](#logical)**                 | ✅ Always     | Common rules for finding bugs and enforcing good logical practices in YAML files.     |
| **[`logicalStrict`](#logicalstrict)**     | ☑️ When Ready | Additional rules for finding bugs and enforcing good logical practices in YAML files. |
| **[`stylistic`](#stylistic)**             | ✅ Always     | Common rules for consistent styling and best stylistic practices in YAML files.       |
| **[`stylisticStrict`](#stylisticstrict)** | ☑️ When Ready | Additional rules for consistent styling and best stylistic practices in YAML files.   |

If you are just getting started with linting, Flint recommends using the [`logical`](#logical) and [`stylistic`](#stylistic) presets:

```ts title="flint.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, yaml } from "flint";

export default defineConfig({
	use: [
		{
			files: yaml.files.all,
			rules: [yaml.presets.logical, yaml.presets.stylistic],
		},
	],
});
```

If you are experienced with both YAML and linting, Flint recommends using the [`logicalStrict`](#logicalstrict) and [`stylisticStrict`](#stylisticstrict) presets:

```ts title="flint.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, yaml } from "flint";

export default defineConfig({
	use: [
		{
			files: yaml.files.all,
			rules: [yaml.presets.logicalStrict, yaml.presets.stylisticStrict],
		},
	],
});
```

### `logical`

Rules that find bugs and enforce good YAML practices for most-to-all YAML files.

```ts title="flint.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, yaml } from "flint";

export default defineConfig({
	use: [
		{
			files: yaml.files.all,
			rules: yaml.presets.logical,
		},
	],
});
```

### `logicalStrict`

Additional logical rules that enforce best practices which are not always straightforward to implement.
These rules are recommended for projects where a majority of developers are experienced with both YAML and using a linter.

```ts title="flint.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, yaml } from "flint";

export default defineConfig({
	use: [
		{
			files: yaml.files.all,
			rules: yaml.presets.logicalStrict,
		},
	],
});
```

This preset's rules are a superset of those in [`logical`](#logical).

### `stylistic`

Rules that enforce consistent styling and best stylistic practices for most-to-all YAML files.

```ts title="flint.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, yaml } from "flint";

export default defineConfig({
	use: [
		{
			files: yaml.files.all,
			rules: yaml.presets.stylistic,
		},
	],
});
```

### `stylisticStrict`

Additional stylistic rules that enforce best practices which are not always straightforward to implement.
These rules are recommended for projects where a majority of developers are experienced with both YAML and using a linter.

```ts title="flint.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, yaml } from "flint";

export default defineConfig({
	use: [
		{
			files: yaml.files.all,
			rules: yaml.presets.stylisticStrict,
		},
	],
});
```

This preset's rules are a superset of those in [`stylistic`](#stylistic).

## Rules

<RulesTable implementing plugin="yaml" />

## Selectors

Flint's YAML plugin provides the following file selector:

- `all`: `**/*.{yaml,yml}`
