:::danger
Flint is still very early stage and experimental.
Not all features have been implemented.

:::tip
Rules are grouped into plugins that you can opt into.
See [Rules](/rules) for an overview of how rules are sorted into plugins.
:::

This is a full table of all rules that will be implemented in the main Flint project.
It includes rules from all three provided categories of plugins: [Core](/rules#core), [Focused](/rules#focused), and [Incubator](/rules#incubator).
Each rule is equivalent to at least one existing rule in another linter.
