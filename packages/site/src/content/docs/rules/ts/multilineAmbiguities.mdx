<RuleSummary plugin="ts" rule="multilineAmbiguities" />

When a line ends with an expression and the next line starts with certain characters (parentheses, brackets, or template literals), JavaScript may interpret them as a continuation of the previous line rather than separate statements.
This can lead to unexpected behavior and runtime errors that are difficult to debug.

## Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="❌ Incorrect">

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

```ts
const value = identifier(expression)
doSomething();
```

```ts
const data = getArray
[0].value;
```

```ts
const result = calculate
`template literal`;
```

```ts
function process() {
	const a = b
	(c || d).execute();
}
```

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="✅ Correct">

```ts
const value = identifier;
expression.doSomething();
```

```ts
const data = getArray;
[0].value;
```

```ts
const result = calculate;
`template literal`;
```

```ts
function process() {
	const a = b;
	(c || d).execute();
}
```

```ts
const value = identifier(expression).doSomething();
```

```ts
const data = getArray[0].value;
```

```ts
const result = calculate`template literal`;
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Options

This rule is not configurable.

## When Not To Use It

If you consistently use semicolons and have tooling that enforces their presence, this rule may be unnecessary.
However, having this rule enabled provides an additional safety net against accidental multiline ambiguities.
