Using `javascript:` URLs is a form of `eval`. Code passed in `javascript:` URLs is parsed and evaluated by the browser in the same way that `eval` is processed.
This can lead to security vulnerabilities and is generally considered bad practice.

Use event handlers or proper JavaScript functions instead of `javascript:` URLs.

## Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="❌ Incorrect">

```typescript
location.href = "javascript:void(0)";
```

```typescript
const url = "javascript:alert('XSS')";
```

```typescript
const link = `javascript:void(0)`;
```

```typescript
window.location = "javascript:doSomething()";
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="✅ Correct">

```typescript
const url = "https://example.com";
```

```typescript
const url = "http://example.com";
```

```typescript
const url = "/page";
```

```typescript
const data = "data:text/plain;base64,SGVsbG8=";
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## When Not To Use It

If you have specific use cases where `javascript:` URLs are necessary (though this is rare), you can disable this rule for those cases.
