In addition to configuring rules in your `flint.config.*` file, you can also disable specific rules inline in your code using comment directives.
This is useful when you need to suppress a rule for a specific line, block, or file.

All inline directives are comments that follow the pattern `flint-<directive-type>-<rule-id>`:

* For JavaScript-like languages: `// flint-...`
* For Markdown and HTML-like languages: `<!-- flint-... -->`
* For YAML: `# flint-...`

Flint supports the following directives:

- [`flint-disable-file`](#flint-disable-file): Disables one or more rules for the entire file.
- [`flint-disable-lines-begin`](#flint-disable-lines-begin): Disables one or more rules for a range of lines.
- [`flint-disable-next-line`](#flint-disable-next-line): Disables one or more rules for just the next line of code.

## `flint-disable-file`

Disables one or more rules for the entire file.
This directive must appear at the top of the file, before any code.

```ts title="example.ts"
// flint-disable-file forInArrays
const array = ["a", "b", "c"];
for (const i in array) {
	console.log(array[i]);
}
```

You can specify multiple rule IDs separated by spaces, or use multiple directives:

```ts title="example.ts"
// flint-disable-file forInArrays
// flint-disable-file namespaceDeclarations
```

## `flint-disable-next-line`

Disables one or more rules for just the next line of code.

```ts title="example.ts"
const array = ["a", "b", "c"];
// flint-disable-next-line forInArrays
for (const i in array) {
	console.log(array[i]);
}
```

## `flint-disable-lines-begin` and `flint-disable-lines-end`

Disables one or more rules for a range of lines.
Use `flint-disable-lines-begin` to start disabling rules, and `flint-disable-lines-end` to stop.

```ts title="example.ts"
// flint-disable-lines-begin forInArrays
const array = ["a", "b", "c"];
for (const i in array) {
	console.log(array[i]);
}
// flint-disable-lines-end forInArrays
```

You can nest multiple begin/end pairs, and they will stack:

```ts title="example.ts"
// flint-disable-lines-begin forInArrays
// flint-disable-lines-begin namespaceDeclarations
const array = ["a", "b", "c"];
for (const i in array) {
	console.log(array[i]);
}
// flint-disable-lines-end namespaceDeclarations
// flint-disable-lines-end forInArrays
```

## Rule IDs

The rule ID in a directive should match the rule's identifier.
For example:

- `forInArrays` for the TypeScript rule that warns about `for...in` loops on arrays
- `namespaceDeclarations` for the TypeScript rule that warns about namespace declarations
- `altTexts` for the JSX rule that requires alt text on images

You can find rule IDs by looking at the [rules documentation](/rules) or by checking the error message when a rule reports an issue.

## Unused Directives

Flint will report if you use a directive that doesn't match any reports.
This helps you identify directives that are no longer needed or have incorrect rule IDs.
