	<Card title="Approachable and Fun" icon="heart">
		Who knew you could fall in love with your linter? Flint provides intentional
		defaults and rich reporting that surface only the kinds of issues you'll
		want it to find.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Cache-Friendly and Fast" icon="rocket">
		Flint is architected with an industry-leading intelligent cache and an
		architecture that eliminates duplicate CI workflows for adjacent tasks such
		as formatting and type-checking.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Powerful Typed Linting" icon="rocket">
		Flint builds the most useful class of lint rules that use the full power of
		TypeScript's type checker to find bugs in your code.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Streamlined Configuration" icon="document">
		Flint configs embrace readability and power. They give you control over your
		linter without making you learn its internals.
