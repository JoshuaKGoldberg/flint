Flint is still very early stage and experimental.
Not all features have been implemented.

Flint will provide a comprehensive set of rules for all languages common to most typical web development projects.
Rules are grouped into plugins that you can opt into as you choose.

Plugins are grouped into three categories:

- **[Core Plugins](#core-plugins)**: Those applicable to any project using their language.
  They come as part of the [`flint`](https://npmjs.com/package/flint) npm package.
- **[Focused Plugins](#focused-plugins)**: Those for large areas of projects or code styles that are applicable to many, but not all, likely Flint users.
  They come in separate npm packages under `@flint.fyi/`.
- **[Incubator Plugins](#incubator-plugins)**: Area-specific plugins that should exist under community governance, but don't yet have a dedicated team outside of Flint working on them.
  They come in separate npm packages under `@flint.fyi/`.

## Core Plugins

These come as part of the [`flint`](https://npmjs.com/package/flint) npm package.
They're applicable to any project using the language they lint for.

<PluginCards plugins={Object.values(pluginDataByGroup.core)} />

## Focused Plugins

These are large areas of projects or code styles that are applicable to many, but not all, likely Flint users.
They come in separate npm packages under `@flint.fyi/`.

<PluginCards plugins={Object.values(pluginDataByGroup.focused)} />

## Incubator Plugins

Area-specific plugins that should exist under community governance, but pending a dedicated maintenance team outside of Flint's, are being developed as part of the Flint project.
They come in separate npm packages under `@flint.fyi/`.

<PluginCards plugins={Object.values(pluginDataByGroup.incubator)} />
